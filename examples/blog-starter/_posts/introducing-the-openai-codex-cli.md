Embark on a new era of developer productivity with the OpenAI Codex CLI, a powerful command-line tool designed to streamline code generation, testing, and deployment through natural language prompts.

## Overview

The OpenAI Codex CLI brings the power of OpenAIâ€™s Codex models directly to your terminal. By leveraging natural language, developers can generate code snippets, refactor existing code, and automate common tasks without leaving the command line.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Prompts**: Describe the code you need, and Codex CLI produces syntax-correct, ready-to-use snippets.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generate code in Python, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, and more.
- **Context-Aware Refactoring**: Provide existing files or directories; Codex CLI can improve, optimize, and document your code.
- **Interactive REPL**: Test small code fragments and iterate quickly within an interactive shell.
- **Extensions & Plugins**: Customize workflows by writing plugins for code linting, formatting, and CI/CD integration.

## Approval Modes

Codex CLI ensures compliance and safety with configurable approval modes:

1. **Manual Approvals**: Preview generated changes and accept or reject modifications.
2. **Automated Policies**: Enforce custom rules (e.g., license headers, security policies) before code is applied.
3. **Trusted Workflows**: Grant elevated permissions to specific commands or teammates to bypass reviews when safe.

## Quick Start Instructions

1. **Install the CLI**  
```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex-cli
```  
2. **Authenticate**  
```bash
codex auth login
```  
Follow the interactive prompt to log in with your OpenAI account.  
3. **Generate Code**  
```bash
codex generate "Create a function that reverses a string in JavaScript"
```  
4. **Refactor Code**  
```bash
codex refactor src/utils.js --describe "Improve performance and add JSDoc comments"
```  
5. **Run Interactive REPL**  
```bash
codex repl
```  
Type natural language instructions to experiment with code snippets in real time.
